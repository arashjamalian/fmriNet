    "This notebook takes the BOLD5000 dataset and prepares it for use in a deep learning model. Since the dataset is the direct output of fmriprep, we still need to perform a few steps before it is ready to train on.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we must regress out nuisance signals. In fMRI analysis, many nuisance signals are gathering from the processing pipeline and are linearly regressed or detrended from the whole brain timeseries. Some commonly used nuisance signals include motion parameters (rigid body motion involves three translation, three rotation parameters), average CSF signal, average white matter signal, and all their derivatives. The regression of the global signal - or the mean signal across all brain voxels - is highly contended in the fMRI field. Many consider it to be physiological noise, others consider it to contain important neural information. For our purposes, we will not regress out global signal. Our goal is to decode visual stimuli features from fMRI timeseries of visual areas of the brain. A recent study on the global signal showed that the visual cortex contains much of variance in the global signal topography [1]. For this reason, we will only regress out six motion parameters, two biological, and their derivatives. We can pull these signals from one of the fmriprep files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, we must extract the timeseries data of brain regions that are involved in visual processing. We will use the visual regions defined in the HCP MMP 1.0 atlas. We will take these binary masks and mutiply them to each subject's fMRI data to extract the information we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to label each part of the timeseries data with the image it corresponds to and package the resulting data into neat X and Y matrices.\n",

    "Now that we have the fMRI data fully preprocessed, we will need to extract the ROI timeseries of all the visual region masks that BOLD5000 kindly provided, and match the correct labels from the events file. The result will be an X and Y for each ROI mask. The X will be of shape (samples, timepoints, features) and Y will be of shape (samples, classes). Since each stimuli is presented for about 1 seconds with 9 seconds in between each, we will take 10 second windows for each class label. With a TR of 2 seconds, each sample will have 5 TRs of all the voxels in that ROI for each corresponding class label. The datasets will be concatenated for all runs, sessions, and subjects. Thus, the resulting data will be saved in the output directory specified (data_dir), one X and Y for each ROI.\n",
